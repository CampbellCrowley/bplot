# bplot

A simple set of plotting tools built on top of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).  I write these functions with two things in mind:

  1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) practice, and
  2. [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) is great!, but I seem to think at the level layer rather than the categorical variable (factor) layer.

[Documentation](https://roualdes.github.io/bplot/) is in development.
