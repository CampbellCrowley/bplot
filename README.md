# bplot

A simple set of plotting tools built on top of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).  I write these functions with three things in mind:

  1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) practice,
  2. [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) is great!, but I seem to think at the level layer rather than the categorical variable (factor) layer, and
  3. this API makes more sense to me than does matplotlib's or [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/)'s.

  Much of the work here is just a [shim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)) over matplotlib's functions, with words I prefer.
